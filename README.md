# calculator
Use html to create the skeleton of the computers
it has numbers from 0-9, addition, subtraction,multiplication,division, a clear button, delete button and decimal point button
Using CSS i created the styling to the buttons
Using javascript 
Add an event listener so that the calculator is responsive... When the numbers buttons are pressed, the numbers should appear on the display box
When the operators buttons are pressed, the operators should be concatenated to the buttons so as to form an infix expression
The clear button when pressed should clear everything from the display box
When the delete button is pressed, the last item in the display box should be deleted
The calculator has parenthesis so as to be able to use the shunting yard algorithm to do the evaluations by first converting the infix notation to postfix notation
When the equals sign is pressed the calculator  should evaluate the postfix notation expression and give the correct answer
Round off the decimal points to 1 for easier calculation
